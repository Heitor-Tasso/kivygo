# RadialSlider

The `RadialSlider` is an angular slider widget, which acts similarly to
the kivy's native linear slider.
The RadialSlider has two components: a **track** and a **thumb**. The thumb ‚Üí ‚óè, can be dragged along the circular path of the track ‚Üí ‚óØ, with an angle
ranging from 0 to 360 degrees.

You can define the position of the **thumb** via the `angle`, the `value`, or the `normalized_value`. 
Note that these values are also automatically updated as the thumb is dragged.

## Install
    pip install kivy_garden.radialslider

## Import
    from kivy_garden.radialslider import RadialSlider

## Tips and Considerations:

### Widget size setting

The Radial Slider will adjust to the smallest size, between height and width.
Setting different sizes for the width and height is not recommended, as although the visible path and thumb will adjust to the smallest size, the widget as a whole will still conform to the size you set.

While setting the size incorrectly does not compromise the functionality of the widget itself, you might be overwriting another widget's area resulting in unexpected behavior of the other widget.

The example bellow shows the difference between the unespected behavior with wrong fitting and the correct fitting. The red area shows the real widget size.

`size_hint: (None, None)` <br> `size: 250, 200` ‚ùå   |`size_hint: (None, None)` <br> `size: 200, 250` ‚ùå  | `size_hint: (None, None)` <br> `size: 200, 200` ‚úîÔ∏è


If you want to set the size based on `size_hint`, the proper way would be:

<br>

For adjust the height to the width:
```yaml
size_hint: (your_size_hint_x, None)
height: self.width
```

<br>

Or for adjust the width to the height:
```yaml
size_hint: (None, your_size_hint_y)
width: self.height
```

<br>

Or just using the `size` property:
```yaml
size_hint: (None, None)
size: your_width, your_height # one value must be the same as the other
```

<br>

üü° If the parent of the RadialSlider widget has equal width and height dimensions, eg: `size: (200, 200)`. You can use size `size_hint_x` and `size_hint_y` freely, **as long as you set the same value for both**, like: `size_hint:(0.5, 0.5 )`, `size_hint:(0.2, 0.2)`, etc.

## Example:

The RadialSlider widget provides the essential components: *Thumb* ‚Üí ‚óè, and *Track* ‚Üí ‚óØ.

But with a few lines of code, you can change its appearance as you wish. Take a look at the example below, how easy it is.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kivy-garden/radialslider/develop/doc/images/example.gif)

```python
RadialSlider:
    size_hint: (None, None)
    size: 200, 200
    track_color: "#DEDEDE" # gray track
    track_thickness: 15
    canvas.before:
        # white background
        Color:
            rgba: rgba("#FFFFFF")
        Ellipse:
            size: self.size
            pos: self.pos
    canvas:
        # blue line
        Color:
            rgba: rgba("#3086BD")
        Line:
            width: 15
            circle: self.center_x, self.center_y, self.width/2 - 15, 0, self.angle
            cap_precision: 500
    Label:
        pos: self.parent.center_x - self.width/2, self.parent.center_y - self.height/2
        text: "{}%".format(int(self.parent.value))
        color: "#808080"
        font_size: dp(35)
```

Every push or pull request run the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/kivy-garden/flower/actions) CI.
It tests the code on various OS and also generates wheels that can be released on PyPI upon a
tag. Docs are also generated and uploaded to the repo as well as artifacts of the CI.
