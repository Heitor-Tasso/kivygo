## Usage Summary

This project is an implementation of Swipe Behavior. 
SwipeToDelete widget is built on Swipe Behaviour as a test case.
This widget can be used to create dynamic layouts where users can delete UI widgets by swiping them left or right. 
Swipe behavior, when combined with a widget allows swiping within a rectangular area.

Latest commit adds some new features.

## How It Works


Import in your python file or kivy file
```
from kivy.garden.swipetodelete import SwipeBehavior
class DragWidget(SwipeBehavior,BoxLayout):
```
Use in your kivy file or python file
```
<DragWidget>:
  swipe_rectangle: self.x, self.y , self.width, self.height
  swipe_timeout: 1000000
  swipe_distance: 1
```

See example.py file for more.
